The contents of this repository are related to the collection of data as part of an Ecological Impact Assessment conducted on two sites in Lochranza, on the Isle of Arran. Whilst the proposed scenario of a landowner wishing to invest in Ecological Restoration on one of the two slopes on site is fictitious (as the main purpose of this exercise is for an MSc Coursework Assessment); the data collected is real, and we conducted real environmental surveying on and off-site in order to address the proposed scenario with an Ecological Impact Assessment. 

The stages of this assessment included (but were not limited to):
(1) A desk-based survey for preliminary assessment of the site, and to gather pre-existing information on the habitats and biodiversity present. 
(2) A Phase-One Habitat Survey conducted in the field, in order to assess the vegetation and habitats present on each slope. 
(3) Field data collection, focused on the assessment of vertebrate and invertebrate communities present on each site, as requested by the landowner. 
(3) Visualisation and interpretation of the data collected, which was then used to inform 'decisions' about which site should be regenerated, and which conservation approach(es) should be used in order to conduct this ecological restoration. 

Data collection for this project was collaborative, whilst all coding, data visualisation and interpretation was conducted independently for the purpose of the assessment. For any clarification or queries related to any of this project, do not hesitate to get in contact with me.
